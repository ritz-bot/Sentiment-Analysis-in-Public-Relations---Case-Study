# Sentiment-Analysis-in-Public-Relations---Case-Study

## Overview

Welcome to this case study where we will explore the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the public relations department of a multinational corporation. This case study is designed to help you develop skills in handling and analyzing text data, with a focus on sentiment analysis. By the end of this study, you will be equipped to automate sentiment analysis on social media posts and product reviews to determine customer satisfaction.

## Business Case

### Problem Statement

In today's digital age, companies receive vast amounts of data from their customers through various channels such as social media, product reviews, and customer feedback forms. This data, primarily in text format, holds critical insights into customer satisfaction and brand perception. However, manually reviewing and analyzing this data is impractical due to its sheer volume.

The Public Relations (PR) department of a multinational corporation has collected extensive data from customers across multiple platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and more. The goal is to determine whether customers are satisfied with the company's products or not based on their reviews and social media posts. 

### Objective

The primary objective of this case study is to build a predictive model using NLP techniques to automate the sentiment analysis of customer reviews and social media posts. By converting textual data into numerical representations, the model will classify whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative, thus indicating customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

This automation will enable the company to quickly and accurately gauge public sentiment, allowing for timely and informed decision-making in their PR strategies.

## Case Study Workflow

The case study is divided into several tasks to guide you through the process of building a sentiment analysis model. Below is the step-by-step outline of the tasks we will cover:

### Task 1: Understanding the Problem Statement and Business Case
- Define the problem statement.
- Understand the importance of sentiment analysis in the PR department.
- Outline the goals and objectives of the case study.

### Task 2: Importing Libraries and Dataset
- Import essential Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- Load the dataset containing customer reviews and social media posts.

### Task 3: Data Exploration
- Perform an initial exploration of the dataset.
- Understand the structure and content of the data.
- Identify any potential issues or patterns in the data.

### Task 4: Data Cleaning
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
- Prepare the text data for further processing.

### Task 5: Text Preprocessing - Removing Punctuations
- Learn techniques for removing punctuations from the text data.
- Understand the importance of text normalization in NLP.

### Task 6: Text Preprocessing - Removing Stop Words
- Identify and remove common stop words from the text data.
- Understand the role of stop words in improving model accuracy.

### Task 7: Text Preprocessing - Tokenization and Count Vectorization
- Convert text data into numerical data using tokenization.
- Apply Count Vectorizer to create a matrix of token counts.

### Task 8: Applying Preprocessing Techniques
- Combine the preprocessing steps (Tasks 5, 6, and 7) to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Ensure the text data is ready for machine learning model training.

### Task 9: Introduction to Naive Bayes Classifier
- Learn about the Naive Bayes algorithm and its application in text classification.
- Understand the mathematical concepts behind the Naive Bayes classifier.

### Task 10: Model Training - Naive Bayes Classifier
- Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the prepared dataset.
- Use the classifier to predict customer sentiment.

### Task 11: Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier.
- Analyze the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Task 12: Assignment - Logistic Regression Classifier
- As an assignment, implement a Logistic Regression classifier to compare its performance with the Naive Bayes classifier.
- Train, evaluate, and draw conclusions from the comparison.

## Conclusion

This case study provides a comprehensive approach to applying NLP techniques in the context of public relations. By following these tasks, you will gain valuable insights into how to handle text data, build predictive models, and automate the sentiment analysis process, ultimately helping your organization to make data-driven decisions in their PR strategies.

We hope you enjoy this learning experience and gain the practical skills necessary to solve real-world business problems using data science and NLP.
